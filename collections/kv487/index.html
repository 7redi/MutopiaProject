<h2 align="center">Mozart's Twelve Duets for Horn (KV 487)</h2>

<p>This is a PD edition for the mutopia project (<a href="http://www.mutopiaproject.org/">http://www.mutopiaproject.org/</a>) of KV 487, following the edition prepared by Otto St√∂sser in 1961. (This edition was graphically reproduced by Masters Music Editions, Florida).</p>

<h4>Editorial Remarks</h4>

<p>There are some oddities, which I corrected to my best knowledge.</p>

<ul>
<li>No1, horn 2 ends on low e.  This must be an error, the piece is in F-major, and horn 1 plays f'</li>
<li>No 3: slurring of the appoggiatura in measure 20 is inconsistent'</li>
<li>No 4: uses appoggiatura in measure 20 and 21. I have substituted acciaccatura'</li>
<li>No 7, horn 1: uses portato (slur &amp; dot) in measure 8. This is inconsistent.'</li>
<li>No 8: measure 35 uses a dotted half note in 2/4 time.'</li>
<li>No 9, horn 1: measure 2 has a printing error, where a 8th note is not beamed.'</li>
<li>Finally: the pieces are inconsistent with dynamics. In some pieces, the same dynamics are indicated for each staff separately, while in other pieces dynamics are shared between staffs.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Performance Remarks</h4>

<p>Horn-Guru Hans Pizka &lt;Hans.Pizka AT t-online.de&gt; remarks:</p>

<blockquote>
According to Viennese tradition, the Mozart Duets should be played in the following transpositions (or on the respective  natural horns): 1 = C, 2 = F, 3 0 C, e = Eflat, 5 = Efl, 6 = C, 7 = C, 8 = Efl, 9 = C, 10 = C, 11 = Efl, 12 = Efl.<br />
(numbering according to Mozart Gesamtausgabe Serie XXIV, Nr.58 suppl.)<br /><br />
The transposition is not because of the high notes, but because of the music. They sound just best in these transpositions or played on the respective natural horns.
