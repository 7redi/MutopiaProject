<h2 align="center">Notes</h2>

<p>In this appendix I report errors and incongruences I found in the source text used to prepare this book: the Breitkopf &amp; HÃ¤rtel edition, 1882 (from now on, B&amp;H). I do not own another edition, so in the cases where the B&amp;H edition had some oddities, I referred to the Philips recordings of these quartets made by Quartetto Italiano in 1966. By the way, I recommend these beautiful recordings to every music lover.</p>

<h4>String Quartet KV. 387</h4>

<p><i>Allegro Vivace Assai</i>, bars 103-104. The tie in bar 104 starts from the D in bar 103 (thus being a slur).</p>

<center><img src="notes-1.png" width="376" height="62" alt="Bars 103-105" /></center>

<p>This seems to be a typing mistake, since bar 105 has a tie. Moreover, a slur would not match the Violin II and Cello parts.</p>

<p><i>Andante Cantabile</i>, bar 14. The Violin I part has a blank space instead of the eighth rest.</p>

<p><i>Andante Cantabile</i>, bars 49-51. In every instrument the last note is a sixteenth; this is of course an error, since the duration of every bar would be 3/4 + 1/32. For example, the Violin I part is written in the following manner:</p>

<center><img src="notes-2.png" width="360" height="52" alt="Bars 48-50" /></center>

<p>I chose to change sixteenth notes into thirty-second notes because it is the same solution adopted by Quartetto Italiano, but of course there is the possibility that the error is in the dotted rests.</p>

<p><i>Molto Allegro</i>, bar 80. The B&amp;H text reports the possibility that the cello part has a natural D instead of a D sharp. In the same way, it reports that in bar 85 the second note (C) might be a C sharp.</p>

<p><i>Molto Allegro</i>, bar 205. The Cello has a blank space instead of the G.</p>

<h4>String Quartet KV. 421</h4>

<p>No significant errors were found in the B&amp;H edition.</p>

<h4>String Quartet KV. 428</h4>

<p>No significant errors were found in the B&amp;H edition.</p>

<h4>String Quartet KV. 458</h4>

<p><i>Allegro vivace assai</i>, bar 27. The B&amp;H text reports a G in the viola part, but it is probably a mistake (see bar 163).</p>

<p><i>Allegro vivace assai</i>, bar 155. This bar is <i>not present</i> in the B&amp;H score. It is without doubt a mistake, since none of the slurs that begin in bar 154 is properly closed.</p>

<p><i>Adagio</i>, bar 16. The last note of the viola has not the natural sign before it. A C flat would be strange because of the dissonance with the C in the Violin I part.</p>

<h4>String Quartet KV. 464</h4>

<p>In general, the B&amp;H edition is not very coherent in marking the tuplet numbers. When reorganizing them, I chose not to note every change to the source text here in order not to over-lengthen these notes.</p>

<p>The B&amp;H score uses no tremolo marks at all. I used some of them to save print (especially in the cello part).</p>

<p><i>Andante</i>, bar 104. The Violin II part has an ambiguous C sharp instead of E. This is strange since there is no cautionary accidental before the note (the previous and following bars both have natural C):</p>

<center><img src="notes-3.png" width="223" height="66" alt="Bars 103-105" /></center>

<p>The E was suggested by the Philips recording. This is a good solution since it matches bar 95, Violin I part.</p>

<h4>String Quartet KV. 465</h4>

<p>Cautionary alterations were not reported coherently in this quartet (where alterations have such a great importance!). I added some of these to each movement (not reported in these notes).</p>

<p>Tremolo marks are present in the B&amp;H score only with sixteenth notes (e.g. bars 238-255, fourth movement). I added some tremoli of eighth notes to the first two movements in order to conserve some space on the page (e.g. opening bars, cello part).</p>

<p><i>Adagio - Allegro</i>, bar 187. The Violin I part of the B&amp;H score is the following:</p>

<center><img src="notes-4.png" width="220" height="54" alt="Bars 187-188" /></center>

<p>The second G sharp is probably a printing mistake. I converted it into a F, in order to match bar 67.</p>
