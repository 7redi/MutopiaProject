The three directories contain three copies of the String Quartet in E
minor by Gaetano Donizetti.


autograph/  

    An (almost) unaltered copy of the autograph.  Every slur, tie,
    alteration and tuplet number is copied in the score.  Errors found
    in the source were not corrected.  File autograph/README contains
    some information about the source used as well as some historical
    notes about Donizetti and this quartet.


edited/

    A modified version of the autograph score.  Almost every error is
    corrected (except for doubtful passages), and various improvements
    were made to improve the readability of the score.  See file
    edited/README for more information.


midi/

    This is derived from the edited score, and its *only* purpose is
    to create the MIDI files.
