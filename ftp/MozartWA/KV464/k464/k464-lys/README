This is Mozart's String Quartet KV. 464 for two violins, viola and
cello.  I typeset it using Lilypond 1.6.6 and the aid of GNU M4 to
conditionally define the repeats in the third and fourth movement,
since in this piece there are alternatives that are needed in the
score but unnecessary for the solo parts (e.g. second movement, bar 44
has an alternative which is needed only in the viola part).

To typeset the score, you have to run m4 on the k464-*.ly.m4 files
with the -DSOLO=1 option if you are creating a solo part, and run M4
without options for k464-score.ly.m4.

The provided makefile will do this automatically; type "make help" to
get a list of possible targets.
