%		Please note that there are some problems with the original score (lots of  %	%	errors, poor printing, and omissions). I have corrected what I could find, but     %
%	most certainly missed some. Please let me know if you find any problems so that    %
%	I may update the file for everyone.						   %
%		For those who know German, my apologies upfront. I'm not sure if I	   %
